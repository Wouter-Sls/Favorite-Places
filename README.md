# favorite_places

In this app the user can add favorite places with a picture and a location.

During this application I learned how to take an image with your camera and use it by using the image_picker library. Furthermore, I learned how to get the current users location.
Unfortunately I couldn't fully complete this project because I had to connect credit card information to google to use the Maps platform api.
